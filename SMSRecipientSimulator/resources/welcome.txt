* Welcome to SMS Recipient Simulator!!                              *
*                                                                   *
* This application simulates the behavior of a phone when it        *
* receives an SMS. This is a great tool for you to study and test   *
* SMPP Protocol Parameters, especially message_payload, esm_class,  * 
* etc. You can simulate and learn how Concatenated SMS and UDH work,*
* as well as the implementation of message_payload.                 *
*                                                                   *
* This simulator is able to connect and bind to SMCS and receive    *
* PDUs from it. But you must connect it with a TESTING SMSC or an   *
* SMSC simulator such as SMPPSim. Then it compares the destination  *
* address of the PDU with its own phone number. If the PDUs belong  *
* to it, then it combines the PDUs (if necessary) and print out the *
* received SMS. The SMS can be an individual short short message,   *
* concatenated SMS, and message_payload.                            *  
*                                                                   *
* WARNING: Do NOT connect this simulator to any production SMS      *
* Center. If you do, then the SMPP Receiver in the production       *
* environment will lose some of the replies from customers.         *
*                                                                   *
